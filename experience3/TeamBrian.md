## Summary of experience

We began the meeting with a fun activity to energize the team. The team showed significant improvement in presentation time, though it did not meet the specified 7-minute mark. I was impressed with their growing confidence and encouraged them to enhance their presentations further, as this month's performance was not as captivating as the previous month. I motivated the mentees to excel in upcoming tasks.

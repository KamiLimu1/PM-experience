## Summary of experience

The session was 3-hour long with all mentees present. We were able to go through the May sessions where each mentee shared what they learnt. A point I really liked was how they each shared what stood out for them and how it affected their personal growth. 

We also went through Responsible Computing where we talked about the ethical responsibility that comes with building and using software used by millions of people and affects the opinions and decisions of others. We talked about the negative side effects such as the Cambridge Analytica story as well as examples of good use of data collection to solve human problems like the Apple Watch.

We finally closed with the task on Languages of Apology where we were all able to define what an apology means to us and what counts as an apology. We went through the apology options and what each choice had and lacked.

## What was amazing

We were initially planning to meet physically for this session but had to pivot later towards an online session. My mentees had planned an inclusive skit and had shown great teamwork to come up with the ideas and script but had to drop it as we transitioned to online. They still came up with thoughtful presentations that showed that they had incorporated my feedback from last time as well as put their time in their presentations. They showed up in the best way they could and I appreciate that!

## Summary of Experience

The objective of this activity was to engage with our mentees and delve into their initial
month of learning. We initiated the session with interactive icebreakers such as Slido, "2
Truths and a Lie," and sharing intriguing facts about one another. The mentees showcased
their impressive presentations, and we discussed creating a safe space and integrating it
into our interactions. Furthermore, we openly communicated our expectations within the
mentee-to-peer mentor relationship, setting a solid foundation for the upcoming seven
months of collaboration. This kickoff session set a positive tone, ensuring a productive and
supportive journey ahead.

| ----------- | ----------- |------|
| Fidel|WebPage | The passion and determination that Fidel has for KamiLimu. His presentation outlined his learning experience in a way that felt like a recap of everything and a new person would have been brought up to speed in that presentation. His craftsmanship in the making of the website was amazing |
| James   | Canva Slides     |  James’s ppt designs were off the charts. He is a great designer as much as he is in security. His presentation like Fidel’s was clear picture of how James is dedicated to his journey at KamiLimu.

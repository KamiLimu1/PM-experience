Date of Meeting: 29th June 2024  
Mode of Meeting: Virtual  
Task: 3

## Summary of experience

We started the session with a ‘How are you’ check-in where the team shared what they have been up to since our last meeting and how they feel about the start of the competitions. 

For task one, the mentees shared their presentation on the month three lessons, and feedback was given after the presentation. For task two, we discussed responsible computing and it was interesting and eye-opening to learn how we will promote Responsible computing in our future careers.  For task three on Responsible Relationship Building, guided by the discussion points, we shared what responsible relationship building meant. We gave examples of different experiences on how we can cultivate responsible relationship-building. We concluded task 3 by sharing our results on the Languages of Apology test and shared scenarios on how we would apologize to others.

## What was amazing 

The mentees' new approach to presenting their monthly lessons. It showcased their creativity and summarised the key takeaways from month 3 sessions. There has been an improvement in time management while making presentations. The open-ended guiding questions on Responsible Computing and Responsible Relationship Building helped us get to know each other better and gain new perspectives from each other.

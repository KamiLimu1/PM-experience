## Summary of Experience

Session 1

The first session was thrilling and provided a wonderful start. During this session, the whole
team made introductions, which included a 'how are you' portion to check in and see how
everyone was doing. Sherry Obare then delivered a presentation. We ran out of time and
chose to have the session on Thursday the same week to accommodate mentees who
were still taking their end-of-semester exams.

Session 2

During the second session, Jean and Abigael presented their learning outcomes, which
were followed by a feedback session among mentees and then from peer mentors to
mentees. Following that, we discussed age and level of experience as two factors to
consider when creating a safe space for the team members and how that extends to
KamiLImu as a whole. The final half of the discussion was dedicated to discussing
expectations, establishing ground rules, and determining how we would like to operate as
a team. We concluded the meeting on a positive note, looking forward to the next one.


### Mentee Presentations

| Name of the Mentee| How they shared the Lessons|What stood out from the presentation|
| ----------- | ----------- |------|
| Jean Wanjira| A poem | Her presentation was a poem about all the lessons she had learned during her one month at KamiLimu. I thought that was a very creative way to showcase lessons so far. The whole team enjoyed the presentation. |
| Sherry Obare   | A PPT presentation     |  Her slides were quite neat and very engaging. This made it easy to follow through and understand what she was trying to convey. Being the first to present gave a good starting point for the other mentees to benchmark from.    | 
|Abigael|A PPT presentation|Abbyâ€™s presentation was very expressive and tapped into her vulnerability. It was amazing that she was brave enough to take us through her journey before and at KamiLimu thus far while highlighting how the lessons at KamiLimu have impacted her growth. She also employed storytelling and very specific examples, which made the presentation lively and engaging.|

### What was amazing?

During the sessions, each mentee was very engaged and gave their full participation. Additionally, they invested a great deal of time in carefully preparing for the presentations and having attended some of the sessions; it had the feel of a reflection of the lessons learned. The crew seemed to communicate exceptionally well, which added authenticity to the flow and created a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere for productive engagement.

## Summary of Experience

The session kicked off with introductions, with the mentees introducing themselves first, followed by the peer mentor. Next, each mentee presented their work, and received individual feedback from the peer mentor on how they could improve their presentations. Following this, the mentees discussed what they could have done differently and provided feedback to each other. The team then went over the guidelines for both mentees and mentors from the code of conduct, setting clear expectations for everyone involved. The mentor then collected the mentees' resumes and wrapped up the meeting.

### Mentee Presentations

| Name of Mentee | How they shared the Lessons | What stood out from the presentation |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Sally Mulupi    | PPT Presentation    | Sally had good content for her presentation and I appreciated that she was not reading along to the presentation but stating points on the presentation then elaborating.     |
| Prince Gichere    | PPT Presentation    | Prince had very good slides and visuals for his presentation. He was also very outspoken and confident when speaking.     |


### What was amazing?
During the session, the mentees were lively and engaging. They also take criticism without getting defensive and they are good communicators. Both mentees had a good recollection of the Kamilimu sessions taken so far with a good grasp of the topics discussed and remembered particulars like the session speakers. They also had fond memories of the ‘How are you’ session during the physical meeting. Generally, it was a good bonding session to get to know them and their aspirations.

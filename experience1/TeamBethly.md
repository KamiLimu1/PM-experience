## Summary of Experience

The session began with introductions and an interactive play session that set the mood for the
meeting. The mentees then proceeded to present the lessons they learned in their first month,
each in their own creative way. I loved how they were already applying some of the lessons
learned at KamiLimu, especially the CV writing skills and public speaking. Something that stood
out for them about KamiLimu, was its culture of embracing people and being warm to
everyone. This resulted in a discussion on safe spaces and how we can all apply this core value
in our lives. We also practiced giving each other constructive feedback, which was a great
learning experience.

For the second half of our session, we discussed on our expectations of each other and how we
can all support one another in this mentorship journey.

### What was amazing?
The play session we had served to help us know more about each other and I loved and appreciated the different personalities that each had. I really cannot wait to see their uniqueness unfold and their talents bloom in the remaining months. I also loved to see their commitment to KamiLimu and how they all put in the work in their amazing presentations. Yes, there is much that can be improved on but for a first, they did a great job. It was also encouraging to see the number of lessons they have learned and the impact they have had in their academic life within one month.

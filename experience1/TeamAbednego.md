## Summary of Experience

The mentees presented their month one presentation and went over their highlights for the first month and it was really good to feel that their excitement is very much alive and they’re energized for the coming months.

We then went over the section on Guidelines for mentees in the KamiLimu code of conduct. This opened a really great conversation around what the mentees are
expected to do and what they are entitled to in KamiLimu. It also allowed them to align their goals for this mentorship program with the guidelines. In particular, we highlighted
the role that mentees have to play towards creating an environment that enables not just them to achieve their goals but also their peers.

With this being the first meeting, we also spoke of how we are going to work together and in particular each individual’s best way of collaborating. We went over our
expectations for each other and how we can support each other to bring our best self in the peer mentorship meetings.

towards each other and would give feedback really well as well.

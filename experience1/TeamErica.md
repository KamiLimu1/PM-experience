## Summary of Experience

Collins Loves animations and talked about his takeaways from his recent animation, 
Tiffany is quite passionate about mental health. Her passion is derived from her desire to serve and see everyone thriving. Rachael loves to sing. She plays guitar so beautifully too.

We recamped that innovation, not all comprises of new ideas but also renovating the existing ones. Afterward, mentees gave feedback to their team members while the Mentor spoke about how to give better and captivating presentations.

 Towards the end of the meeting, we agreed that we were the best and wanted to be the best team. This is to be achieved by the mentor giving support to the mentees and cultivating a family spirit in the team (teamwork). Mentees also are expected to show up and show their best for all sessions, assignments, and every other activity in KamiLimu.

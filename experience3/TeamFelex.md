## Summary of experience 

In Month 3 of KamiLimu, we embarked on an enriching journey through the realms of responsible computing, human-centered problem solving, and responsible relationship building, while also honing skills in GitHub, playful learning, public speaking, storytelling with presentations, and data structures. Our session began with warm greetings and catching up, fostering a relaxed and engaging atmosphere. Each mentee had 7 minutes to present their learnings creatively. Steve Muiga dazzled us with a detailed PPT on data structures and algorithms, Peter Wambua captivated with his storytelling, weaving lessons from KamiLimu into a narrative, and Dorcas Nkrote brought her presentation to life with a song that explained problem identification and the role of GitHub in safeguarding our code. 

The feedback session was a highlight, where mentees shared their thoughts on each other’s presentations, creating a supportive and constructive environment. As a peer mentor, I provided feedback tailored to each presentation, celebrating creativity and offering insights for improvement. The diverse presentation styles showcased the unique talents within our group, turning the session into a symphony of ideas and learning. Each mentee's presentation stood out, from Steve’s structured approach to Peter’s narrative flair and Dorcas’s melodic explanations, making the feedback session an enriching experience for all. 

We then delved into the heart of responsible computing, exploring its significance in our digital age. We discussed real-life examples where responsible computing could have prevented negative outcomes, shared dilemmas we've faced in applying these principles, and debated the balance between innovation and ethical responsibilities. Our session ended on a reflective note, contemplating how we can champion responsible computing in our future careers. Through hymns of storytelling, rhythm of presentations, and melody of feedback, we harmonized our understanding of responsible computing, ready to make ethical choices in our digital interactions and professional lives.

## What was amazing 

Reflecting on the past month with my mentees, I am overwhelmed with pride and joy at the incredible journey we've shared. This month was nothing short of magical, as each session became a canvas painted with the vibrant hues of creativity, learning, and camaraderie. The energy in our virtual room was electric, with each mentee bringing their unique spark to our collective flame, making every meeting feel like a gathering of minds destined for greatness. 

One of the standout moments was the presentation session. Steve Muiga transformed complex data structures and algorithms into a captivating story through his meticulously crafted PPT, turning what could have been a dry topic into a thrilling adventure through the world of computing. Peter Wambua’s storytelling was nothing less than a masterclass in narrative magic, weaving the lessons from KamiLimu into a tale that felt both personal and universal. And then there was Dorcas Nkrote, who serenaded us with a song that not only explained problem identification and GitHub but did so with such heart and rhythm that it felt like learning through a beautifully composed symphony. These presentations were more than just educational; they were performances that left us inspired and eager for more. 

What truly made this month exceptional was the bond we strengthened. Each feedback session was a testament to the supportive and nurturing environment we have cultivated. Mentees offered insights and constructive criticism with kindness, and the collective enthusiasm was palpable. The discussions on responsible computing were deep and reflective, with everyone contributing thoughtful examples and engaging in meaningful debates. It was a month where we didn’t just learn about technology and ethics; we lived and breathed it, through hymns of storytelling, melodies of feedback, and the harmonious exchange of ideas. The positivity and growth I witnessed were nothing short of extraordinary, and I am excited to continue this journey with such a dynamic and talented group of individuals.

## Summary of Experience

During our first peer mentorship session held on April 23rd, 2024, we delved into several
key areas of professional development. The topics that garnered the most attention were
resume writing, public speaking, creativity and innovation, and effective learning
strategies.

In the segment on resume writing, mentees shared their experiences of condensing
lengthy CVs into a single page, attributing much of their success to KamiLimu. They sought
advice on enhancing their resumes despite limited experience, to which I suggested
including school projects or volunteer work and emphasizing the value of their
achievements. The mentees expressed eagerness to improve, already submitting their CVs
for review and refinement.

n the public speaking portion, mentees described how the session aided in boosting their
confidence. Initially grappling with nervousness when addressing groups, they emphasized
the importance of preparation to prevent subpar performance.

Our discussion on creativity and innovation centered on distinguishing between the two
concepts. We engaged interactively on ensuring innovation is user-centered, with mentees
recognizing the pitfalls of pursuing perfection at the expense of progress.

Lastly, in the segment on effective learning techniques, we explored various modes of
learning such as diffuse and focused modes. One mentee, George, shared his strategy of
alternating 45 minutes of focused learning with 10 minutes of diffuse learning daily. We
also discussed the benefits of chunking, leveraging procrastination, and utilizing sleep to
enhance memory consolidation. I emphasized the importance of adequate sleep prior to
learning, as it primes the brain for forming new connections.

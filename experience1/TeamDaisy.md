## Summary of Experience

We started the session with introductions and a ‘How are you’ check-in where the team
shared how the experience at KamiLimu has been so far and how they are balancing
KamiLimu and their day-to-day activities. Each of the mentees shared their presentation
and feedback was given after the presentation. In discussing the code of conduct, each of
us picked a theme from Section 4.2 and guided the team in discussing how Kamilimu has
provided a safe environment for them in relation to the theme. The themes discussed in
the session were: Age, Ethnicity, Gender identity and expression, and Level of experience.
We finished the session with us sharing our expectations and how we will create a safe
space within the peer mentorship team. The expectations shared by the mentees guided
the discussion on how I would best support them during the program.

### What was amazing?

I liked the process of getting to know my mentees, their amazing personalities and the goals they look to achieve within the program. This being the first session, it was positive to hear about how they are navigating a new space. During the session, it was great to see the impact Kamilimu has had on my mentees within a month and how the main takeaways from each session was in line with their goals in the program.

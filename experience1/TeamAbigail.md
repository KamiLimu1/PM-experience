## Summary of Experience

The session began with introductions from both peer mentees and myself, followed by
presentations from mentees and the feedback session. Afterward, we discussed the
code of conduct of KamiLimu, with a particular focus on issues related to race and
ethnicity/nationality.

### Mentee Presentations

| Name of the Mentee| How they shared the Lessons|What stood out from the presentation|
| ----------- | ----------- |------|
| Angela|WebPage | Angela's presentation stood out with its simplicity and confidence.Instead of colorful visuals, she opted for a black-and-white theme, yet it exuded a sense of exceptionalism. By incorporating Abdul's advice about CVs being like shirts—long enough to cover everything but short enough to stay interesting—Angela crafted a concise, yet detailed presentation. Notably, she included a photo of herself beaming with a wide smile, adding a personal touch to her delivery. |
| Joy   | Shared slides     |  Joy's presentation showcased her organizational skills through a clear, chronological structure. Utilizing numerous images, she brought vibrancy to her slides—a stark contrast to Angela's monochromatic approach. Joy's colorful personality shone through her dynamic choice of hues, resulting in a visually appealing presentation that captivated the audience's attention.  | 
|Danny|Shared Slides|Danny's presentation seemed hurried, perhaps because he did not pay attention to the template provided, as a result, he failed to deliver a presentation that matched the caliber of Joy and Angela.|

### What was amazing?
The mentees appreciated the inclusivity they have seen at KamiLimu. They were in awe of how professionalism can be intertwined with play and easiness. During the session, every mentee showed enthusiasm and was quite charged up for the journey at KamiLimu.

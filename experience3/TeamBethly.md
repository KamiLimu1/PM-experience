## Summary of experience

The session began with a ‘How are you’ check-in session and a reflection on how their May experience has been. We then proceeded to the presentations and it was encouraging to see nearly all my mentees going beyond their comfort zones and trying something different from their previous presentations. I noticed there was great improvement in their confidence and overall presentation skills. We then went through responsible computing where we reflected on the lessons learned in the session and shared our  perspectives and application of it. Finally, we had a wholesome conversation on the topic Responsible relationship building. We shared our different views on the subject, the challenges we have faced, and how we hope to work on intentionally improving ourselves. The prompt questions  and language of apology test were helpful in driving our conversations and it was encouraging to see how open the mentees were.

| Shadrack Anyona | A Canva , presentation | I liked how he started his presentation by inviting us to his class, capturing our attention. His slides were neat and creative. I also liked how each slide held its own lessons and how he flowed through them beautifully. Truly enjoyed his class and this was one of his best presentations so far. Great improvement and creativity noted on the canva slides. | A chalkboard-like canva presentation of the lessons learned. He presented like a teacher presenting to a class and that made it easier to follow. |  |
| Sharon Chang’ach | A video | I liked her creativity and use of play to showcase the lessons learned. Right from the start the video was engaging and fun to watch and that made it easier to learn. Although the video was short and she expressed that it was challenging to make it longer, we all wished we could watch more of it.  | A short, entertaining video that showcases lessons relationship building, playful learning and ways to make learning memorable. | |
| Eddah Chepchirchir | A poem | I liked how visually appealing her slide presentation was. The title was catchy and I loved how she wove her lessons in the rhyming of words, which I found creative.  | An engaging poem covering the lessons learned in a creative and colorful way. | |

## What was amazing

Their presentations were enjoyable to watch and I liked the improvement witnessed in their creativity and presentation skills. It was impressive to see that most of them pushed beyond their comfort zones to try different ways of doing their presentations and that reflected a lot of progress. For Shadrack, he employed the lessons learned from ‘Storytelling using Presentation in Powerpoint and Canva’ session and that made his ‘class’ presentation fun and engaging. Overall, I was impressed by their use of play to highlight the lessons learned and that made our session enjoyable. I particularly loved the Responsible relationship building session. We had a wholesome conversation with my mentees on the topic and I liked that they were open to share their experiences and perspectives. There was much to learn from each other and borrow from their views.

What was also amazing to see is their improvement in giving constructive feedback of each other’s work.

## Summary of Experience

In order to facilitate effective discussion and accommodate enough time for each task, we
split the session into two parts. The first session was on Monday, and the subsequent
session took place on Thursday. From the Monday session, we introduced ourselves,
mentees did their presentations from their first month Kamilimu sessions, and we shared
our expectations regarding the peer mentorship component during Kamilimu.During the
Wednesday session, we shifted our attention Kamilimu code of conduct 4.1 and 4.2 which
talked about generally spoke about creating a safe space. Together, we carefully reviewed
the resumes of the mentees that I had previously reviewed. I provided feedback for each
mentee, allowing time for further improvement.

### Mentee Presentations

| Name of the Mentee| How they shared the Lessons|What stood out from the presentation|
| ----------- | ----------- |------|
| Sandra |A PPT Presentation and Poem | Sandra had an awesome poem and I loved her creativity in crafting the poem that talked about how she really wanted Kamilimu to change her. The whole team enjoyed the poem.|
| Denish   | A PPT presentation     |  Denish really took his time ranking all sessions from most favourite to favourite. He also had great memories from all the sessions, not just the content but even recalling names of the presenters, speakers and other people who spoke in each session which was really impressive.|
|Collins|A PPT presentation|I loved Vivianâ€™ s slides. She use a creative template showing note-taking like presentation , which was impressive given that the session was from notes|

### What was amazing?

The mentees really took their time in the preparation of the presentations . It really showed how committed they are toward the program and effective note-taking from the sessions. From this first task, I could not help but notice how we had already started developing a great bond and friendship which I know will be very effective to our tasks.

I also went through their dashboards to see the feedback they had given about the session and I appreciate their compliments towards which motivated me and glad that thesession was effective and awesome.

Last but not least, we had fun and laughter in the sessions.

## Team Catherine

Date of Meeting: 26th June, 2024

Mode of Meeting: Virtual 

Task: 3

## Summary of experience

**Task 1- Month’s Learnings** 

The session began with a fun icebreaker game called "First Letter," prepared by Linet. This game involved prompts to name items in different categories and set a lively tone for the session.

For Task 1, the mentees presented a duo presentation on the month’s learnings, styled as news anchors in a newsroom. They reviewed all the sessions they had attended, including Responsible Computing, Human-Centered Problem Solving, Responsible Relationship Building, Using GitHub for Open Source, Learning and Teaching Through Play, Public Speaking 2, Storytelling Using Presentations, and Problem-Solving Using Data Structures. They expertly summarized the key takeaways from each session.

Following their presentation, an interactive discussion ensued, wherein the mentees shared what they thought of their presentation. The content was very creative, and both presenters were articulate, and had great synergy. They maintained an excellent pace, and their use of visual aids, including captions and subtitles, mirrored a professional newsroom setup. One area for improvement would be to reduce the frequency of their hand gestures and instead focus on making more intentional ones.

**Task 2: Responsible Computing**

In Task 2, we delved into the concept of responsible computing. Each member shared their perspective:

* **Linet:** Emphasized inclusivity, stating that responsible computing should encompass everyone.  
* **Kristian:** Highlighted the importance of ethical boundaries in the technology world, particularly concerning AI.  
* **Catherine:** Focused on data privacy, security, and digital literacy.

The discussion then shifted to areas where responsible computing is often overlooked, such as the utilization of AI to automate processes. Questions were raised about whether AI is replacing humans and how data is utilized versus obtaining informed consent. We recognized that while data drives innovation and improves services, it's crucial that subjects are fully informed when giving consent.

We also explored how to create a balance between innovation and ethical responsibilities. Key strategies discussed included regulatory compliance, continuous learning, and promoting awareness.

The conversation was engaging and insightful, highlighting the complexities and importance of responsible computing in the digital age.

**Task 3- Responsible Relationship Building** 

The session started with a discussion on how we define responsible relationship building. Essential qualities mentioned included empathy, honesty, respect, active listening, and consistency. These qualities help in creating meaningful and ethical connections with others.

We then shared our thoughts on the 'Languages of Apology' test and our results. Some were surprised by their results, while others felt they affirmed their usual approach to apologies. This conversation helped us understand how we approach apologies from others and how it affects our relationship building.

The role of self-awareness was another key topic. We discussed how crucial it is for understanding one's strengths, weaknesses, and biases. Actively working on self-awareness helps in recognizing and addressing personal biases, leading to more responsible and effective relationship building.

Members also shared challenges they faced in maintaining responsible relationships, such as miscommunication and  differing expectations. Strategies to overcome these challenges included:

* **Catherine:** Emphasized intentionality and accountability.  
* **Kristian:** Stressed the importance of communicating boundaries and meeting people at their point of need.  
* **Kristian:** Highlighted listening and offering solutions.

Our discussion on effective communication and empathy required vulnerability and self-introspection. We highlighted our points of weakness and how we could improve on them.
